# [WIP] Weapons Classification Assistant

A simple, interactive tool for classifying Small Arms based on the **ARES Arms & Munitions Classification System (ARCS)** and the **SAS Weapons Identification Guide**.

This tool guides users through a step-by-step visual taxonomy to classify an item down to its **type** (ARCS Levels 1–3), then provides guidance on how to proceed toward **identification** (determining make, model, and variant).
